  "name": "Episode IV – A New Hope",
  "description": "The OG, the one that started it all, the game-changer in the world of sci-fi and cinematic history – the one that every movie before was simply leading up to. Director George Lucas used ground-breaking yet simple top-motion special effects to bring an entire galaxy to life. In one movie rife with aliens, robots, and spaceships, words like Wookiee, Jedi, and lightsaber became household names, and theStar Wars universe took the world by storm. The timeline follows exactly where Rogue One left off, but in some ways this is really where Star Wars begins."
